% gen_cvpartition generates k-fold cross-validation random or sequential
%     partition for data of specified size. It returns a structure which
%     consists of test and train indices for each iteration.
%
% Arguments:
%     y: labels.
%     kFold: number of cv folds (default: 10).
%     ifRand: if randomized (default: 1)
%
% Output:
%     idx = Structure of test and train indices.
