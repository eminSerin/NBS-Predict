function varargout = update_NBSPredictFigure(weightAdj,labels,wThresh)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% update_NBSPredictFigure returns thresholded adjacency matrix, graph of
% the biggest subgraph, applying weight threshold provided. It also provides
% labes for nodes found in network after thresholding as well as threshold
% mask. 
%
% Arguments:
%   weightAdj   = Weighted adjacency matrix where edges are weighted. 
%   labels      = Cell array of labels for nodes. 
%   wTresh      = Threshold value.
%
% Output:
%   wAdj       = Thresholded weighted adjacency matrix.
%   G          = Thresholded subgraph graph. 
%   labels     = Labels for nodes found in the subgraph. 
%   mask       = Binary thresholding mask. 
%   
% Example: 
%   [wAdj] = update_NBSPredictFigure(weightAdj,labels,wThresh);
%   [wAdj,G] = update_NBSPredictFigure(weightAdj,labels,wThresh);
%   [wAdj,G,labels] = update_NBSPredictFigure(weightAdj,labels,wThresh);
%   [wAdj,G,labels,mask] = update_NBSPredictFigure(weightAdj,labels,wThresh);
