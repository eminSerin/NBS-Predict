    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    % ConfoundRegression removes variance explained by the confounds from
    % given data. Simply, a linear regression method is fitted on the each
    % feature in a given data using confounds are predictors. Then, it
    % removes variance in the data associated with confounds. 
    %   
    % Parameters: 
    %   data = Data matrix to be corrected. 
    %   confound = Matrix containing confound values 
    %       (Make sure that number of rows is similar to those in data).
    %   
    % Attributes: 
    %   fitParams.weights = Weights for the confounds. 
    %
    % Example: 
    %   correctConfound = ConfoundRegression;
    %   correctConfound.fit(data,confound);
    %   correctedData = correctConfound.transform(data);
