%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Transform weights derived from linear models to activation patterns using
% algorithm shown by Haufe et.al., 2014. 
% 
% Arguments: 
%   X:    Feature matrix (sample x features) 
%   beta: Coefficients derived from linear models (e.g., Linear Regression,
%       Logistic Regression, Lienar SVM)
%
% Output: 
%   activationPattern: Activation pattern. 
%
% Example: 
%   activationPattern = transform_toActivationPattern(X,beta)
