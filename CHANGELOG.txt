## [v1.0.0-beta.4] - 28.10.2021
- NBS-Predict is now in v1.0.0-beta.4
- This version fixes the "check_classifiction function is not found" error.

## [v1.0.0-beta.3] - 23.10.2021
- NBS-Predict is now in v1.0.0-beta.3 
- This version provides hotfixes for a few bugs found in v1.0.0-beta2.
- Fix compatibility issues in the NBS-Predict visualization window. 
- GUI history has been deactivated until the following versions due to unexpected crashes; thus, parameters entered in the setup interface will not be saved for later use!

## [v1.0.0-beta2] - 21.10.2021
- NBS-Predict is now in v1.0.0-beta2.
- Reorganize and clarify function comments.
- Add link for the sample data.
- Update user MANUAL. 
- Add wait/progress bar to the NBS-Predict visualization window.
- Minor change in identifying whether the given data is classification or regression. Target with more than 3 unique values are considered as regression problems.
- Add warnings and error messages in case no features survived the feature selection.
- Refactor a few GUI functions.

## [v1.0.0-beta1] - 13.04.2021
- NBS-Predict is now in v1.0.0-beta1.
- Add user MANUAL and data analysis tutorial. 
- Fix history.mat file issue. 
- Add option to set a specific random seed. 
- Fix several minor issues in the GUI. 
- Add functions for alternative algorithms (elastic net, lasso, p-value thresholding, top 5% and connectome-based predictive modeling (Shen et al., 2017)).
- Add simulation function to evaluate the performance of NBS-Predict and alternative algorithms on simulated network data. 
- Add plot functions to plot simulation results.

## [v1.0.0-alpha3] - 06.09.2020
- NBS-Predict is now in v1.0.0-alpha3.
- Fix several bugs in the GUI.
- Fix bug in the contrast network generation algorithm. 
- Fix minor bugs in assert statements. 
- Minor tweaks in BrainNetViewer to visualize 3D Brain Image better.
- Add functionality to generate synthetic data for regression problems.
- Replace maximum percentile with p-value for pre-filtering. 
- Changed several functions with regards to change in pre-filtering.
- Fix minor issue in function generating parameter combinations.
- divSelect, divSelectWide, simulatedAnnealing search algorithms were removed. 
- Bayesian Optimization is now usable.
- Update hyperparameter space for decision tree estimator.
- Drop weight distribution plot as it might be misleading for interpretation of feature importance. 
- Import circularGraph toolbox written by Paul Kassebaum to NBS-Predict to display circular network figures.

## [v1.0.0-alpha2] - 09.02.2020
- NBS-Predict is now in v1.0.0-alpha2.
- Fix several bugs in the GUI.
- Fix bug in correlation metric. 
- Change default parameters for searching algorithms. Now they have more liberal parameters (e.g., reduced number of iterations).
- Add function to control confounds.
- Add a menu in GUI to choose a scaling method.
- SVM Regression is now built-in function instead of LIBSVM.
- Add Linear Regression, Logistic Regression and Linear Discriminant Analysis
- Add MinMaxScaler, StandardScaler and MaxAbsScaler
- LIBSVM is now removed. Instead, builtin SVM functions are now available to use. They give the same prediction performance as LIBSVM, but are significantly faster. 
- Add preprocessing step in shrinkMat function, that features where information is less than 10% are removed. In this way, very sparse features are now removed. It might be increased to 20% in future updates.
